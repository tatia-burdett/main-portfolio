          <p>I am a semi-nomandic, software developer with a background in nursing. More text here to explain generally who I am and why people should continue to be interested in my page. Short explanation of projects I'm interested in working on, and what I am passionate about in life. What makes me stand out from the rest of the world. Music, photography... a lot about me in a huge paragraph of text.</p>
